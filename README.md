## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to search for books I am interested in so that I can access their information, purchase on Google Books, or save for future reference.


## Description
This is a React-based Google Books Search app. I created React components, worked with helper/util functions, and utilized React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.*
